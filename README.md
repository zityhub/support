# zityhub support bug reporting

zityhub :heart: support

The aim of bug reporting is to explain an issue to zityhub's developers as soon as possible to aid overall project development. Before start writing a bug report, you should know the answers to the following questions:

- What? – What has happened with the application?
- How? – What did we click/do to produce the bug? A good steps to reproduce list should be nice.
- Where? – Where exactly in the app did we find the bug? What is the view or environment)?
